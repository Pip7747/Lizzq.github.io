#  Ensuring Confidence in Software Deployments

As a software developer, I've had my fair share of nerve-wracking deployment moments. A single unnoticed bug in production could cause a cascade of issues and ruin the user experience. That's when I discovered the **magic** of a "Sanity Check" â€“ a simple yet powerful practice that has significantly improved our software deployment process.

## What is a **Sanity Check**?

A **Sanity Check**, also known as a "Smoke Test," is a quick and focused verification process performed before proceeding with more extensive testing or deployment. Its primary purpose is to ensure that **critical functionalities** of the application are working as expected after a change or deployment.

## The Importance of **Sanity Check**

Early on, we faced challenges with frequent deployments triggered by **webhooks** after every commit. While this kept us agile, it also led to the risk of pushing **faulty code** inadvertently. That's when we introduced the **Sanity Check**, and the impact was **profound**:

### 1. **Quick Feedback Loop**

**Sanity Checks** are fast and straightforward, providing immediate feedback on the deployment's basic functionality. With human intervention during **UAT** or test environments, we ensure that only **approved builds** are executed, **saving server space** and preventing unnecessary builds.

### 2. **Confidence in Deployments**

When a **Sanity Check** passes successfully, it instills **confidence** in the development team that the deployment has not introduced any **major defects**. This confidence is crucial, especially in **production deployments**, where any disruption can have **severe consequences**.

### 3. **Reduced Rollback Frequency**

By identifying issues early, **Sanity Checks** reduce the likelihood of **rollbacks**, **minimizing instability and downtime**. This saves time and resources, making our deployment process **smoother and more efficient**.

## How to Conduct a **Sanity Check**

Our **Sanity Check** approach involves these simple steps:

1. **Identify Critical Functionalities:** Determine the essential features of the application that must work correctly for it to be considered **functional**.

2. **Create Simple Test Cases:** Design **lightweight test cases** that cover the identified **critical functionalities**. These test cases should be easy to execute and provide clear pass/fail results.

3. **Automate and Integrate:** We automate the **Sanity Check** whenever possible and **integrate it into the deployment pipeline**. However, during **UAT** or test environments, we include a **human interaction** step for approval before proceeding with the deployment.

4. **Execute Before and After Deployment:** Run the **Sanity Check** both before and after each deployment. This helps in comparing the application's behavior before and after the changes, ensuring that the deployment did not introduce any **regressions**.

## Conclusion

Incorporating the **magic** of **Sanity Checks** into our deployment process has been **transformative**. We now have a more **reliable** and **streamlined deployment pipeline**, with human approval acting as the final gatekeeper during crucial stages. The **Sanity Check** has given us the **confidence** to deploy changes with peace of mind, knowing that we've done our due diligence to ensure the **stability** and **correctness** of our applications.

So, the next time you deploy new code or updates, consider the **magic** of the **Sanity Check**. It might just be the key to unlocking a **smoother**, **more confident**, and **less stressful** deployment experience.
