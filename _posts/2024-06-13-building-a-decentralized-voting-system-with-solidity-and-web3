# Building a Decentralized Voting System with Solidity and Web3

## Introduction

This semester, I undertook a project to develop a decentralized voting system using Ethereum, Solidity, and Web3.js. This initiative aimed to leverage blockchain's inherent security and transparency features to enhance the integrity of the voting process.

## The Problem: Insecure and Opaque Voting Systems

Traditional voting systems often face transparency and security issues. My project sought to resolve these problems by using blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent voting mechanism.

**Solution: Using Ethereum and Solidity**

For the backend, Ethereum provided robust smart contract capabilities, and Solidity was chosen for writing these contracts. These technologies allowed for creating a decentralized application (dApp) that ensures security and transparency.

### Installation and Configuration

The development environment was set up using Ganache for testing and simulation. Ganache is ideal for developing Ethereum applications as it simulates blockchain environments allowing for smart contract deployment and interaction.

## Testing and Production Environments

### Using Web3.js for Frontend Interaction

Web3.js facilitated the interaction between the frontend and Ethereum nodes, ensuring a seamless user experience. This integration was crucial for allowing users to interact with the voting system in real-time.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:7545"));
const votingContract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

async function castVote(candidateIndex) {
    const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
    await votingContract.methods.vote(candidateIndex).send({ from: accounts[0] });
}
